# Pokétypes

Pokétypes is a webapp to help you find the strengths and weaknesses of the different Pokémon type.

It does not handle dual types yet, but these are just multiplicative.

# To use
``` 
git clone git@github.com:AnomalRoil/poketypes.git
cd poketypes
docker compose up -d
```
And it should now be exposed on http://127.0.0.1:8088/
